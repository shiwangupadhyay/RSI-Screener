# RSI-Screener
Forex RSI Analysis and Screener

This project is a Forex trading tool built using Streamlit that helps traders identify potential buy and sell opportunities by analyzing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of various forex pairs across different timeframes (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day). The app retrieves live forex data for over 25 currency pairs from Yahoo Finance and calculates their RSI values using a 14-period window.

Pairs with RSI values below 30 are marked as underbought (potential buy signals), while those above 70 are overbought (potential sell signals). Traders can select specific intervals for analysis, and the app displays the underbought and overbought pairs accordingly. If multiple intervals are chosen, the app shows combined results to highlight forex pairs meeting the criteria across all selected timeframes.

This screener simplifies technical analysis for forex traders by automating RSI calculation and presenting easy-to-interpret signals for informed trading decisions.
